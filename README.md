This is the repository for the Cell Well project from INST377 class at UMD.

### Information Problem:
There are currently no smartphone databases tailored for the average smartphone buyer/user.
- Many databases online are overcomplicated
- Average user would have trouble navigating
- An overall usability problem 

### Solutions:
Cell Well is a cellphone website that will provide
a more user-friendly interface and prevent users from going 
through multiple resources. There will be a simple 
navigational structure to the website covering all
facets of a smartphone user needs to find their ideal 
phone. 

### Rationales/Justifications:
The system combines simplicity and all of the 
detailed phone specs into a simple user interface.

### Final Design Solution:

**Homepage:**
Displays the main components a smartphone user looks for when searching for the ideal phone.
Ex. Phone Carriers, Brands, New Releases, Display Size, Operating System, Resolution

**Remainder of Site Design Pages:**
Displays simplistic view of the clicked reference by using large text and graphical guides.
Other smartphone databases overload users with excess information that the average phone buyer
does understand or care about. We will minimize that.
